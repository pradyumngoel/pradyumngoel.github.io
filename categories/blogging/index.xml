      <description>Hello Everybody I&amp;rsquo;m jus here to inform you that I decided to get Tusk Act 4 and currently have Tusk Act 3. Also, I let go of D4C and I just got Silver Chariot Requim&amp;hellip; Although I really want hermit purple.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why people are so crazy about shiny stands. I mean people want six pistols shiny&amp;hellip; Six pistols is the worst stand in the game&amp;hellip; And just because the shiny looks good they want it.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s New Year&amp;rsquo;s Gaming was EPIC. I just got prestige 2 :D. Im going to get some levels and just spam sbr (Steel Ball Run)
I think that since my stand storage is open Im gonna get sptw coz I need a melee stand too.
I know a great sbr strategy with d4c&amp;hellip; Its to dimension hop ALL THE TIME. Especially in the PvP section. As to get away from all the wipers for a good amount of time.</description>
