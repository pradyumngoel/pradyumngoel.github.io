      <description>I started coding in dart and flutter and have already made a lot of progress. I created my own Task Manager app. I didn&amp;rsquo;t publish it yet though.
Flutter may seem difficult to understand at first but then it gets really easy.</description>

      <description>Well I got bored of YBA and wanted to play something else. Then I found this game called Dragonblox Ultimate. It&amp;rsquo;s a very good game and is exactly the type of games which I find most fun. Grinding games.
It&amp;rsquo;s like a simulator. With stats and everything. On the first day itself I got like 50,00 stats and SSJ2 Form. I am currently aiming for Majin SSJ. As my side is evil.</description>

      <description>Well I just tried getting hermit purple through rokas and arrows&amp;hellip; again. Instead when all my rokas finished. I got airsmith. Which is like such a bad stand. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this game will ever give me hermit purple. But I have to keep trying.
Also today I played Roblox Bedwars with my friends. There is this new gamemode (which was there earlier but got removed) called 100 player mode. It&amp;rsquo;s like 24 teams, some colors are same, but the same colors are like some are aplha some are beta some are charlie.</description>

      <description>Hello Everybody I&amp;rsquo;m jus here to inform you that I decided to get Tusk Act 4 and currently have Tusk Act 3. Also, I let go of D4C and I just got Silver Chariot Requim&amp;hellip; Although I really want hermit purple.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why people are so crazy about shiny stands. I mean people want six pistols shiny&amp;hellip; Six pistols is the worst stand in the game&amp;hellip; And just because the shiny looks good they want it.</description>

I think that since my stand storage is open Im gonna get sptw coz I need a melee stand too.
I know a great sbr strategy with d4c&amp;hellip; Its to dimension hop ALL THE TIME. Especially in the PvP section. As to get away from all the wipers for a good amount of time.</description>
