Today's New Year's Gaming was EPIC. I just got prestige 2 :D. Im going to get some levels and just spam sbr (Steel Ball Run)

I think that since my stand storage is open Im gonna get sptw coz I need a melee stand too.

I know a great sbr strategy with d4c... Its to dimension hop ALL THE TIME. Especially in the PvP section. As to get away from all the wipers for a good amount of time.

I guess I don't need to try to get prestige 3 because It's not really that helpful so I'll be fine with Prestige 2
